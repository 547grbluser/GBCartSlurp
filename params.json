{"name":"GBCartSlurp","tagline":"Raspberry Pi gameboy cart dumper","body":"### About GB Cart Slurp\r\nGBCartSlurp is a C program for Raspberry Pi to read out the contents of GameBoy and GBC savegame data that can be used in emulators but will also conveniently dump the ROM contents as well for personal backup. The project is based/inspired heavily by @insidegadgets [GBCartRead project](https://github.com/insidegadgets/GBCartRead)\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\nIn order to build a cartridge reader, you'll need a raspberry pi, a Gameboy cartridge socket, and two MCP23017 I2C GPIO Port expanders, and either some breadboard/prototyping board or create a PCB (Pi HAT design to come. In the meantime, inside gadgets has a [DMG-001 socket to 0.1\" header pin](http://www.insidegadgets.com/projects/gameboy-cart-adapter/) PCB layout suitable for prototyping)\r\n\r\nThe cartridge socket connects to the port expanders like so:\r\n* Address lines A0-A7 connect to 23017#1 port A 0-7\r\n* A8-A15 connect to 23017#1 port B 0-7\r\n* Data D0-D8 connect to 23017#2 port A 0-7\r\n* Ancillary lines connect to 23017#2 port B 0-2\r\n    * ^WR -> B0\r\n    * ^RD -> B1\r\n    * ^CS -> B2\r\n23017's should be set to be address 0x20 and 0x21 (or edit the code to use a different address if this conflicts with other I2C devices)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
